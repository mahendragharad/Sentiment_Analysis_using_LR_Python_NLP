# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

## Overview

The **Sentiment Analysis Web Application** is a Python-based project that predicts sentiment (positive or negative) of user-provided text using a trained machine learning model. It leverages natural language processing techniques, including text preprocessing, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction, and logistic regression for classification.

## Features

1. **Predict Sentiment:**
   - Users can input a piece of text (e.g., a review, comment, or tweet).
   - The application preprocesses the text by tokenizing, converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating stopwords.
   - It then applies lemmatization to standardize word forms.
   - The cleaned text is transformed into TF-IDF features.
   - The trained logistic regression model predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

2. **Web Interface:**
   - The application provides a simple web interface with an input field for users to enter their text.
   - After prediction, the result (positive or negative sentiment) is displayed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahendragharad/Sentiment_Analysis_using_LR_Python_NLP
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the Sentiment Analysis application.

## Customization

- You can fine-tune the model by experimenting with different classifiers (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes) or hyperparameters.
- Adjust the preprocessing steps in the `clean_text` function to suit your specific use case.
